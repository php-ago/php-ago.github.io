# What is Ago?
**Ago** is a Zero-Dependency PHP library that provides a simple and intuitive way to format dates and times into a human-readable "n time ago" format. Whether it's `1 hour ago`, `2 days ago`, or `Just now`, this library makes it simple to provide localized, human-readable date formatting.

You can read our [Usage Guide](/v4/usage-guide) to learn how to use **Ago** in your projects.
